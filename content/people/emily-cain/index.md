Emily is a scientific programmer with a focus on curating data from the Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Arizona for research funded by the National Science Foundation. She is interested in and has studied sustainable agriculture on a global scale at the University of Michigan and Uppsala University in Sweden, and has also worked as a farm apprentice in Texas to support local, community-supported agriculture. She is excited about the possibilities of leveraging technology and data-driven discovery to transform agriculture and its environmental impact.

Before she transitioned to programming and data science, Emily worked as a psychiatric Registered Nurse for five years. She received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Michigan in 2008 and a Bachelor of Science from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2011.
