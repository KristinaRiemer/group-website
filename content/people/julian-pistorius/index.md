Julian is a software engineer who specializes in scaling software 'up and out' using High Throughput Computing as well as cloud infrastructure. He has extensive experience in debugging, profiling and optimization of software. He also teaches these techniques to researchers. In addition he has experience testing, deploying, and supporting systems at scale on POSIX platforms. Julian's areas of interest include Machine Learning and Data Science Literacy.

Before joining CALS he worked on CyVerse's Atmosphere cloud computing product. He has a peculiar interest in decentralized, 'organic', anti-fragile computing systems.

He received a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.), Computer Science in 1998 from the University of Auckland, New Zealand.
