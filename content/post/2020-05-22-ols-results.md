### First draft

Our group has successfully completed the [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) (OLS) program, which we [previously wrote about getting accepted to](https://datascience.cals.arizona.edu/news/2020/01/diag-accepted-open-life-science-program).

The purpose of OLS, an offshoot of Mozilla Open Leaders, is to improve open science practices within life sciences communities. The program is run by [Yo Yehudi](http://yo-yehudi.com/), [Malvika Sharan](https://malvikasharan.github.io/), and [Bérénice Batut](http://bebatut.fr/), all of whom we got to know during OLS. 

In this first cohort, there were 29 mentees with 20 mentors. Throughout the program, the mentees would meet every other week with their mentor to discuss their project and next steps. On opposing weeks, the mentees met collectively with the organizers. These cohort meetings included lots of excellent guest speaker talks, such as [Karin Lagesen](https://folk.uio.no/karinlag/) on codes of conduct, [Alex Chan](https://alexwlchan.net/) on designing for inclusion, and [Josh Simmons](https://joshsimmons.com/) on open licensing. Then to summarize and celebrate everyone's progress during the 18 weeks of the program, all of the mentees delivered short presentations, which are on [YouTube](). 

Something that OLS emphasized that I was not expecting but was the most important was an emphasis on, not just how to do science openly, but how to build a community up around open science products. This community-first perspective, building inclusive and welcoming communities, is really important and something we should consistently be thinking about and working on. 

Our group, which provides and maintains software and data for agricultural research, had several overall goals for the program. We are constantly working to make our products more accessible and usable to anyone who would benefit from them. To do so, we need to identify our users and their needs, and how to fulfill them. We want to enable users to be able to contribute back to this software and data based on their invaluable experiences. 

For OLS, we decided to focus on making these kinds of improvements on the documentation for our [drone processing pipeline](). OLS was a great experience for learning more about how to do this and implementing some productive changes. These are summarized below, and also in [our final OLS presentation](https://github.com/az-digitalag/organization/blob/master/presentations/20200520_OLS.pdf). 

We made progress on organizing the already dense and complicated documentation available for the drone processing pipeline so that it is more intuitive and usable. We decided that the main website for the project should be [the OLS wiki for the pipeline](), with the main landing page for users being the [home page](). This links to the code base and community health files in repos in [the GitHub organization](), which then links to [more technical documentation aimed primarily at developers](). 

We additionally had a chance to sit down and talk to one of the users of a similar pipeline. He had insightful comments on its usability, including that having an more experience user to help was crucial and that the number of technical tools one needs to be familiar to us it is substantial. We are planning on having future such conversations with potential and actual users and developers of the pipeline, so that we can identify their successes and pain points with the pipeline documentation. 

One of the most useful assignments we did throughout the program was to create some [personas]() for the pipeline. Basically a description of a possible user and what their steps up to contributing could be, from first contact to bllabla. We'll be adding these to the pipeline website soon. 

Excellent experience, we learned a lot and are looking forward to continuing to build the communities around our datasets and software. We hope to keep in touch with all of the excellent participants in the Open Life Science program. They are all working on amazing projects, including [running a Twitter account that curates biodiversity knowledge](https://twitter.com/BiodivFoco) by [Bruno Soares](https://twitter.com/Bruno_E_Soares) and [Naraiana Benone](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Naraiana_Benone2) and [creating an open science culture](https://chiarabertipaglia.github.io/Infusing-a-culture-of-open-science-within-the-community-of-the-Zuckerman-Institute/) by [Chiara Bertipaglia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiarabertipaglia/), amongst many others.
