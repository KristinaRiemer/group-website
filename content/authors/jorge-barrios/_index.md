Software engineer with a diverse background of programming experiences. Everything from Data Science to hardware maintenance and security to game development and so on. Always looking and willing to learn anything new (even sometimes to a detriment). Always willing to try and solve problems. Areas of interest include Machine Learning/AI, Art in all its forms, and tinkering, especially when it involves electricity.
