Our software will be used and collaboratively developed by researchers at major land grant universities, global ag research centers (e.g. CG), and industry. We will enable scientists to spend less time engineering bespoke pipelines and collecting redundant data so that they can spend more time developing algorithms, augmenting existing data with strategic data collection, and analyzing data.
